### Introduction
A **production-grade Universal Ad Postback Pipeline** is a collection of serverless micro-services that capture post-conversion web-hooks ("postbacks") from multiple ad networks‚Äî**Sedo, Tonic, Crossroads, MediaNet, Airfind, Apex**, and more‚Äîthen normalise and stream them into high-performance analytics stores such as **MongoDB**.

* üõ∞  Built with **AWS Lambda**, **API Gateway**, **SQS**, and **SAM** for effortless scalability and low cost.
* ‚öôÔ∏è  Each network lives in its own *controller* (see `controllers/*`) so you can deploy, update, or roll back sources independently.
* üöÄ  End-to-end latency is measured in **milliseconds**, enabling near-real-time reporting for growth and BI teams.

### Setup
1. **Prerequisites**
   - Node.js **18 LTS** (or higher)
   - Docker (for local Lambda execution)
   - AWS CLI + AWS SAM CLI
   - An AWS account with permission to create Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, S3, IAM, and CloudWatch resources

2. **Clone & install**
```bash
# Clone
 git clone https://github.com/your-org/universal-ad-postback-pipeline.git
 cd universal-ad-postback-pipeline

# Install NPM dependencies for every Lambda (one-liner)
 find . -name "package.json" -maxdepth 3 -execdir npm ci \;
```

3. **Secrets configuration**
Update **MONGODB_URI** and **FB_TOKEN** in the following templates before deploying:
   - `controllers/apex-postbacks-controller/template.yaml`
   - `controllers/airfind-postbacks-controller/template.yaml`
   - `controllers/sedo-rsoc-postbacks-controller/template.yaml`
   
   You can also override them at deploy-time using `--parameter-overrides`.

### Infrastructure Deployment
> All stacks are defined with AWS SAM. A convenience **Makefile** sits inside every service directory.

Deploy a single controller (example: **Sedo**):
```bash
cd controllers/sedo-postbacks-controller
make deploy-stack           # sam deploy ‚Äî no prompts
```
Tail its logs:
```bash
make tail-logs
```

Remove the stack:
```bash
make destroy-stack
```

#### Deploy the unified API proxy
The folder `postbacks-handler/` exposes a single HTTP API and fans-out incoming postbacks to SQS queues for each network.
```bash
cd postbacks-handler
make deploy-stack
```
This creates:
* API Gateway (custom domain `example.com`)
* SQS queue `raw-postback-events`
* Proxy Lambda ‚Üí queue fan-out
* S3 data-lake bucket for raw logs

---

### Integration of a New Postback Source
1. **Bootstrap**: copy one of the existing controllers and rename it `<network>-postbacks-controller`.
2. **Transform**: implement `interpret<Network>Data()` inside `utils.js` to map the incoming query-string to the canonical schema (see [`interpretSedoData`](controllers/sedo-postbacks-controller/utils.js) for reference).
3. **Storage**: choose **ClickHouse** (`ClickHouseRepository.js`) or **MongoDB** (`MongoDBRepository.js`).
4. **Routing**: add a route in `postbacks-handler/proxy_src/app.js` so the API Gateway forwards `/<your-path>` to the new SQS queue.
5. **Deploy**: run `make deploy-stack` in your new controller directory.

> üí° Hot-reloading locally: `make run-local` spins up a Dockerised Lambda with the example event under `events/event.json` so you can iterate quickly.
